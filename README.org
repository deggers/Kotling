* Kotling (Just-Another-Sideproject)
Just an idea about possible implementation to have a nicer developer expierience while doing UI.

** ðŸŽ¯ Features
- JavaFX like DSL abstraction for Swing
- I18n Support (to be implemented)
- Model-View-Intend (to be implemented)
** ðŸ’¡ Philosophy
When developer have to switch form JavaFX to Swing for various reason, they are dealing with a learning curve before they can start building their front-end applications. Kotling, as a UI framework, was created with the idea of minimalism and follows the UNIX way, so that developer can quickly enter the world of Swing with a warm and trusted welcome.

Kotling is inspired by TornadoFX, the most popular JavaFX DSL on the Internet. If you have ever implemented a front-end application using JavaFX or similar, then many methods and principles will seem very common to you.

** ðŸ‘€ Examples
*** BorderPane
The concept of a BorderPane is taken from JavaFX. It gives the possbility to set into the borders, top, left, bottom, right or the center any Component.
#+ATTR_HTML:title="BorderPane" width 100px
[[BorderPane][file:colorfulborderpane.jpg]]

This is possible via the DSL using plain JPanels:
The actual code for this using plain JPanels is the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC kotlin
  class BorderPaneDemoView : KotlingView("Demo") {
      override val root = borderPane {
          top = JPanel().also {
              it.background = Color.ORANGE
              it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
          }
          left = JPanel().also {
              it.background = Color.RED
              it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
          }
          bottom = JPanel().also {
              it.background = Color.GREEN
              it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
          }
          right = JPanel().also {
              it.background = Color.BLUE
              it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
          }
          center = JPanel().also {
              it.background = Color.LIGHT_GRAY
          }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

Or by constructing a KBorderPane via its named arguments:
#+BEGIN_SRC kotlin
class ConstructorBorderPaneDemoView : KotlingView("Demo") {
    override val root = KBorderPane(
        top = JPanel().also {
            it.background = Color.ORANGE
            it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
        },
        left = JPanel().also {
            it.background = Color.RED
            it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
        },
        bottom = JPanel().also {
            it.background = Color.GREEN
            it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
        },
        right = JPanel().also {
            it.background = Color.BLUE
            it.preferredSize = Dimension(200, 200)
        },
        center = JPanel().also {
            it.background = Color.LIGHT_GRAY
        }
    )
}
#+END_SRC
